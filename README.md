## Description

The Iron-Carbon Phase Diagram Interactive Tool is a graphical application that allows users to interact with the iron-carbon phase diagram. It provides a visual representation of different phases (like Austenite, Ferrite, Cementite, etc.) and allows users to hover over the regions to see more information, such as phase names and images. This tool is built using Python, Tkinter for the GUI, and Matplotlib for plotting the diagrams.

## Features

- Display the iron-carbon phase diagram with interactive polygons representing different phases.
- Show tooltips with phase names and images when hovering over the polygons.
- Dynamically adjust the alpha of the polygons on hover to highlight them.
- Easily update phase data and re-render the diagram.
